# Text_to_3d_Model
This project provides a lightweight and flexible system that converts any input text—Thai, English, Japanese, or any language supported by your font—into a fully-generated 3D model (.OBJ). The pipeline uses a bitmap-based approach to ensure high compatibility without relying on heavy libraries or platform-specific text rendering engines.
